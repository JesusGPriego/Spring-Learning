# Spring-Learning

Here I will be uploading my Spring framework learning progress.

# Fists steps:

Here I show my first steps with Spring. Those, basically are:


* xml file configuration
* dependancy injection (xml file)
* dependancy injection (property file)
* Singleton and prototype patterns
* init and destroy methods.

I know this all is kind of deprecated, but the teacher keeps that this is the right way to learn the framework.

# Spring with annotations:

The progression continues. Now i've learnt how to set an spring file using annotations.
I also have learnt how to inject dependancies with annotations, basically this is it in this project.

Annotations seen:

* @Component
* @Autowired and @Qualifier
* @Scope
* @Bean
* @Configuration
* @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy
* @PropertySource and @Value
