# Spring-Learning

Here I will be uploading my Spring framework learning progress.

Disclaimer: All the apps have been tested in TomCat 9.0, using java 8 to compile the projects.

# Fists steps:

Here I show my first steps with Spring. Those, basically are:


* xml file configuration
* dependancy injection (xml file)
* dependancy injection (property file)
* Singleton and prototype patterns
* init and destroy methods.

I know this all is kind of deprecated, but the teacher keeps that this is the right way to learn the framework.

# Spring with annotations:

The progression continues. Now i've learnt how to set an spring file using annotations.
I also have learnt how to inject dependancies with annotations, basically this is it in this project.

Annotations seen:

* @Component
* @Autowired and @Qualifier
* @Scope
* @Bean
* @Configuration
* @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy
* @PropertySource and @Value

# MVC With Spring

In this lesson i've lernt how to build apps using MVC
pattern with Spring. 
I have also learnt how to provide static content.


# MVCFormTags

In this lesson, I've leart how to create forms with Spring.
I've also learnt how to validate the forms, using Hibernate Api,  with tags like:

* @Size
* @NotNull
* @Min and @Max
* @NotEmpty
* @Pattern
* And a custom annotation: @PostalCode

Additionally to this, I've learnt how to create custom exception errors messages to show in the forms.

# DataAccessWithHibernate

In this lesson, I've learnt how to access data with Hibernate framework. I've leaernt:

* Hibernate configuration using xml file.
* Mapping with annotations.
