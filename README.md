# Spring-Learning

Here I will be uploading my Spring framework learning progress.

# Fists steps:

Here I show my first steps with Spring. Those, basically are:


* xml file configuration
* dependancy injection (xml file)
* dependancy injection (property file)
* Singleton and prototype patterns
* init and destroy methods.

I know this all is kind of deprecated, but the teacher keeps that this is the right way to learn the framework.
